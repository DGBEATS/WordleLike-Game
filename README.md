# WordleLike-Game

A Wordle-like game built using Python, C++ and Go. This game a adds spin on Wordle which includes a timer to give a sense of urgency to completing the game.
I wrote this game in 3 different programming languages using 2 different programming paradigms, which are: Python (Procedural), C++(Object-Oriented) and Go(Procedural).

### Prerequisites

1. These codes can be run using [Replit](https://replit.com/~).
2. In the same directory as the code, create a txt file called "wordle_words" where c=you can store the 5 letter words of your choosing. (Separate the word with indented spaces, an example txt file is included.)
3. No further prerequisites are needed unless you would like to run the code on a local IDE.

### Steps
1. Open the Replit website page and create a new space to paste the code.
2. Copy the txt or py files to the apporpriate created space for writing the code.
3. Run the code in Replit. (Compilation may take a minute.)

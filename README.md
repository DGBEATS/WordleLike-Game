# WordleLike-Game

A Wordle-like game built using Python, C++ and Go. This game a adds spin on Wordle which includes a timer to give a sense of urgency to completing the game.
I wrote this game in 3 different programming languages using 2 different programming paradigms, which are: Python (Procedural), C++(Object-Oriented) and Go(Procedural).
